# vhm2nvhm

Simple utility for migrating Apache's vhosts created by [vhm](https://github.com/Comandeer/vhm) to nginx's vhosts based on [nvhm](https://github.com/Comandeer/nvhm) syntax. With option `--reverse` provided it performs the opposite operation

## Privileges
vhm messes around with some configuration files, so probably you'll have to use `sudo`

## Errm
Yes, it's written only with me in mind and can be treated as an experiment with writing cli apps using node.js
